Pre-review Background Documents:  A minimum of two weeks before the peer review, the NOAA Fisheries Project Contact will send (by electronic mail or make available at an FTP site/GitHub Repository) to the CIE reviewers the necessary background information and reports for the peer review. In the case where the documents need to be mailed, the NOAA Fisheries Project Contact will consult with the CIE on where to send documents. The CIE reviewers are responsible only for the pre-review documents that are delivered to the reviewer in accordance with the PWS scheduled deadlines specified herein. The CIE reviewers shall read all documents in preparation for the peer review.

Documents for review (available from the public sablefish CIE GitHub repository, as they become available) include:
1.	The 2024 Alaskan sablefish Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report (Goethel and Cheng, 2024) and presentation;
2.	The 2024 December SSC (p. 14-16) and November Joint Plan Team (p. 2-3) reports;
3.	The 2025 Alaskan sablefish stock assessment proposed model changes report (Goethel and Cheng, 2025) produced for the September 2025 Joint Plan Team meeting, presentation, and GitHub repository;
4.	The spatial sablefish model publication and model updates (Cheng et al., 2025a) for the September 2025 Joint Plan Team meeting;
5.	The 2025 AFSC Longline Survey Cruise Report (Siwicke et al., 2026) and presentation;
6.	The 2025 October SSC (pp. 21-23) and September Joint Plan Team (p. 5-6) reports;
7.	The SPoRC assessment platform publication (Cheng et al., 2026) and GitHub documentation;
8.	Research papers on integrating density-dependent growth (Cheng et al., 2025b) and a pot gear fleet (Cheng et al., 2024a) into the sablefish assessment, simulation studies on selectivity (Cheng et al., 2024b) and sex-specific parametrization (Cheng et al., 2025c) for the sablefish assessment, and considerations for fitting sex-specific composition data (Cheng et al., 2025d) in stock assessments;
9.	A summary document of proposed changes to the model for the CIE review, including the full model description and results of the fleets-as-areas proposed model, as well as summary results for all sensitivity model runs;
10.	A document summarizing the results of the spatially explicit simulation experiment and MSE;
11.	Additional supporting documents and presentations as they become available;
12.	Outputs of all analyses used as part of the CIE review, including input data, simulation outputs, final proposed assessment models, and all sensitivity assessment models, as made available on the sablefish CIE GitHub repository.
